			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p> Who am <em>I</em> ? My name is Jalen Jamari Durden! I'm just a guy trying to get out of the food industry 
			and dip my toes into new things. <br> <br>  I think Tech and more specifically Web Development would be very
			interesting to get into. I've talked to different people about the demands of this stuff and the pros and cons
			of this industry and it seems manageable to me.<br><br> Ideally, I'd like to do this as remote work, so that 
			I can travel, live another country, and not do much more physical labor than I have to. Also, would like to be
			more at home and not have to commute somwhere. All in all, working remotely as a web developer would free me up 
			to do a lot more things and have more time to do the things I need and want. And a little more money wouldn't hurt!</p>

			<h2>Football Story</h2>
			<p> Ahhh football. Lovely sport, it is. It's  a passion for me. It's a form of expression for me. It's a way of life for
			me. Football has taken me to places I never would have thought I would reach.<br> I have ADHD,so naturally I have a lot 
			of energy and a little trouble with focusing. However, with football I can center in on the game. I can live in the moment 
			and embrace the present. It also gives me a platform to entertain, which I love to do as well. Through hard work, perserverance,
			and positivity, I gain support and a sense of community from my football club</p>
